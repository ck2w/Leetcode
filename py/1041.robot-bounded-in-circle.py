# Testcase Example:  '"GGLLGG"'
#
# On an infinite plane, aÂ robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north.
# The robot can receive one of three instructions:
# 
# 
# "G": go straight 1 unit;
# "L": turn 90 degrees to the left;
# "R": turn 90 degress to the right.
# 
# 
# The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them
# forever.
# 
# Return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the
# robot never leaves the circle.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: "GGLLGG"
# Output: true
# Explanation: 
# The robot moves from (0,0) to (0,2), turns 180 degrees, and then returns to
# (0,0).
# When repeating these instructions, the robot remains in the circle of radius
# 2 centered at the origin.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: "GG"
# Output: false
# Explanation: 
# The robot moves north indefinitely.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: "GL"
# Output: true
# Explanation: 
# The robot moves from (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (-1, 1) -> (-1, 0) -> (0, 0) ->
# ...
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= instructions.length <= 100
# instructions[i] is in {'G', 'L', 'R'}
# 
#
